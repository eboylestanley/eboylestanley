### Hi, I'm Elanor ðŸ‘‹

I'm a <s>accountant</s> **data scientist**. 

I recently completed a Masters of Data Science at the University of British Columbia and previously worked as an accountant (CA-CPA). In any industry, decisions are made on the regular. Previously, I helped business leaders make decisions by providing detailed financial analyses. I want to continue to help people make data-driven decisions that will help them meet their objectives, now with an expanded toolkit! 

I'm passionate about making data easily accessible and consumable by people who may be intimidated or have limited knowledge in this space, so you can count on me to make fun and beautiful dashboards.   

I code primarily in Python, but also have experience in R and SQL.  My goal is to make my work reproducible and automated.  This can range from simple scripts to complex machine learning pipelines.
